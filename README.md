# init.lua

Confuguration scripts for my neovim setup.

## Can you use the config?

Absolutely! Note however, that I am just getting started with neovim.
The configurations might be inefficient or overly tailored to me.

## Motivation

I stumbled upon this highly efficient, experienced programmer on twitch.
He constantly tells his viewers to try out new stuff and "go learn something".
So I ended up trying neovim: a simple, efficient, moddable text
editor that our twitch streamer is using. Shoutout to @ThePrimeagen!

Here are the reasons why I start using neovim:
- by configuring neovim, I learn about the underlying tools and pieces used by
modern IDEs and VSCode
- neovim features a huge set of keybinds and uses a "keyboard first" approach
that will help me get more efficient with coding in general
- neovim runs in the terminal, meaning I also improve at the command-line and
its available commands
- neovim comes with some amazing plugins I haven't seen before, e.g. fuzzy-finding
or treesitter-based syntax highlighting
